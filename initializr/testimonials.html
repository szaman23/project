                       <article class="testimonials">
                            <p>When we started to plan our wedding, we soon realized that hiring someone to help us with day-of wedding coordination was essential to ensure the event would go off without a hitch. After our initial meeting with Kari to discuss how she could help us the day of the event, we immediately felt at ease knowing she would be in control on the big day.</p>
                            <p>Kari worked tirelessly to ensure our vendors met or exceeded our expectations.  Prior to the event, Kari was in constant contact with our vendors and managed all timelines perfectly. We heard from so many of our guests that it was one of the most beautiful and smooth weddings they had ever attended and that credit in large part, goes to Kari. </p>
                            <p>Kari is a strong communicator with a genuine passion for ensuring her clients' expectations are exceeded. She has the unique professional ability to effectively manage situations, people and ideas while maintaining a calm and collected demeanour. We thoroughly enjoyed working with Kari and could not have done it without her!</p>

                       </article>
                       

                       <article class="testimonials">
                            <p>We chose Kari Lywood to be our same-day coordinator and you should too. First, she came highly-recommended by friends of mine who used her for their wedding. My wife wanted to do a lot of the wedding planning herself, and overall we found Kari to be a perfect combination of being hands-on when we needed her and standing back and letting us do our thing while still keeping a watchful eye. </p>
                            <p>At the first meeting we knew we had made the right call: Kari met us at a date, time and location that fit with our schedule and asked us questions about different aspects of our wedding such as theme, venue, decorations, and a whole host of other things that really hadn't occurred to either of us. I believe her first question was about our "vision" for the day and what we hoped it could look like. She gave us the guidance we needed to bring that vision to life. </p>

                            <p>Many meetings and emails later the day of the wedding came and Kari was single-handedly wrangling our families, the flower girl, co-ring bearers (none of whom spoke English, by the way!) and generally making sure that everybody was where they needed to be with a minimum of stress and worry for the bride and groom.</p>


                            <p>We are very glad to recommend Kari for your same-day coordinator. We are confident that she will do as fantastic a job for your wedding as she did for ours. We certainly hope she will...because our wedding was awesome. </p>

                            <p>Thanks again, Kari! </p>

                    <article class="testimonials">
                            <p>At first I was hesistant to hire a wedding planner. Now looking back on my experience with Kari and her involvement in the planning of our wedding I quickly realized that it was the best decision I could have made. Kari spent countless hours working out flower details, discussing decor and planning the overall outline of the day, as well as attending meetings at our venue and with vendors. Her involvement in planning our wedding really made it well organized and stress free, giving us the opportunity to sit back and enjoy every moment.</p>
                            <p> Thank you Kari for doing an amazing job. Your attention to detail is amazing and we would highly recommend you!</p>

                           <article class="testimonials">
                            <p>As our wedding day quickly approached, we realized that we were very anxious about how all our visions would come together and how they would be executed.We reached out to Kari and she swooped in her stylish manner and did exactly what we needed and just in time.</p>

                            <p>Kari took over all the nitty gritty stuff, from finalizing details with the caterer, chasing venue staff and booking last minute hair appointments.
                            She was available to meet the Moms which was never easy and was my personal shoe fairy when I decided on the day I needed Red Shoes!</p>

                            <p>Nothing was untouched by her. She set the room exactly how we wanted right down to lighting almost 150 candles and stringing our twinkle lights.
                            She saved the day when the flowers didn't arrive and no one new either way.Kari, cued the music and the staff, made sure the speeches were on time and that every last detail was just right.</p>

                            <p>We are so lucky we had Kari join us on our journey.
                            She filled a job that was needed and became a trusted companion rooting for us all the way.</p>

                            <p>Thanks a million Kari, no words could express our deep gratitude.</p>
